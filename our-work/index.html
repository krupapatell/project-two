            <h2>Our Work</h2>
            <p>The distribution and subsequent availability of menstrual health products is a just one of the many issues related to menstrual equity that Helping Women Period supports.  Please find resources below regarding international, national and local organizations, articles, and other resources on the subject.  This is by no means a comprehensive list.  Check back for additional updates and new categories to address menstrual health in regards to the transgender population, immigrant/refugee population, the homeless and other related topics.</p>
        <p>Around the world, on any given day, more than 800 million people are menstruating.  And at least five million of those lack adequate resources-including supplies, education, and facilities-for managing their periods.</p>
         <p>In our own country, we have some work to do.  Menstrual health products are ineligible for purchases made with public benefits (WIC or SNAP), they are not readily available in our public spaces such as schools, workplaces or government buildings, not exempt from sales tax, and not available in shelters, crisis centers, jails or prisons.  However, progress is being made on a variety of fronts.</p>
      <p>The number of families in the USA needing assistance from food pantries continues to increase every year. The lack of access to menstrual health products for people who are either homeless or low-income is appalling. These necessary products are not covered by SNAP or any other welfare program.  Each month, this leaves countless people without the products many of us take for granted.</p>
